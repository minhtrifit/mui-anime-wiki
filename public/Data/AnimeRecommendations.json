Within the first 30 seconds of the first episode, I was certain I was re-experiencing a series I had already watched. By the one minute mark, I was thinking \"This is Monogatari isn't it?\" The feeling then bludgeoned me for the remainder of the show. This really isn't odd considering both shows shared much of their talent. Sadly, Arakawa Under the Bridge doesn't reach the highs of the Monogatari series. If you enjoyed this series, I wholeheartedly recommend Monogatari (either watch in release order or look up a watch order guide).","date":"2023-03-05T04:15:00+00:00","user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/GrimGrace","username":"GrimGrace"}},{"mal_id":"29803-48316","entry":[{"mal_id":29803,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/29803\/Overlord","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/7\/88019.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/7\/88019t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/7\/88019l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/7\/88019.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/7\/88019t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/7\/88019l.webp"}},"title":"Overlord"},{"mal_id":48316,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/48316\/Kage_no_Jitsuryokusha_ni_Naritakute","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1874\/121869.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1874\/121869t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1874\/121869l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1874\/121869.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1874\/121869t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1874\/121869l.webp"}},"title":"Kage no Jitsuryokusha ni Naritakute!"}],"content":"The Eminence in Shadow is far inferior to Overlord in many ways, but they both contain the incredibly specific trope of a guy being reincarnated into a fantasy world where he suddenly gains much power and many subordinates, and as a result he has to keep up the act of a perfect and all-knowing leader (when he is really no such thing).","date":"2023-03-05T01:04:00+00:00","user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/blackops23421","username":"blackops23421"}},{"mal_id":"30015-32729","entry":[{"mal_id":30015,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/30015\/ReLIFE","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/82149.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/82149t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/82149l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/82149.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/82149t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/82149l.webp"}},"title":"ReLIFE"},{"mal_id":32729,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/32729\/Orange","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1415\/102477.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1415\/102477t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1415\/102477l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1415\/102477.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1415\/102477t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1415\/102477l.webp"}},"title":"Orange"}],"content":"The First anime focuses on the main character Naho getting adressed by a letter from her future self in the next 10 years while the Latter anime has the main character Kaizaki obtain a pill to turn back 10 years of just his appearance and not the timeline, turning to a 17 year old looking kid.

You will undoubtedly enjoy these series.","date":"2023-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/lancelot200","username":"lancelot200"}},{"mal_id":"5251-16245","entry":[{"mal_id":5251,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/5251\/Angel_Densetsu","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/4\/27104.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/4\/27104t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/4\/27104l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/4\/27104.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/4\/27104t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/4\/27104l.webp"}},"title":"Angel Densetsu"},{"mal_id":16245,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/16245\/Seikimatsu_Leader_Gaiden_Takeshi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1013\/128283.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1013\/128283t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1013\/128283l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1013\/128283.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1013\/128283t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1013\/128283l.webp"}},"title":"Seikimatsu Leader Gaiden Takeshi!"}],"content":"The main characters have a very peculiar face and that's a main driver of the action.","date":"2023-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/misterferrari","username":"misterferrari"}},{"mal_id":"227-40747","entry":[{"mal_id":227,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/227\/FLCL","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/7\/77356.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/7\/77356t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/7\/77356l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/7\/77356.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/7\/77356t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/7\/77356l.webp"}},"title":"FLCL"},{"mal_id":40747,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/40747\/Dounika_Naru_Hibi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1924\/106583.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1924\/106583t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1924\/106583l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1924\/106583.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1924\/106583t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1924\/106583l.webp"}},"title":"Dounika Naru Hibi"}],"content":"...it's not entirely-alike, but the third episode is somehow struck me with the feeling 'what it would be like if flcl were made for grown-ups.' overall, the story is done in a fantastically adult, interesting, no-shit way;

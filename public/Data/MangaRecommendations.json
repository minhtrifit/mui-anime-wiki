Both stories are adaptations of the novels of the same name. Both the novel and the manhua \"The Founder of Diabolism\" take place in the \"ancient Chinese\" world where people learn martial arts to achieve immortality. Both the novel and the manhwa \"Dusk Howler\" take place mainly in the virtual MMORPG game \"Trikia\" and sometimes in modern South Korea. The first part of the novel \"Dusk Howler\" tells about the first server (the \"European\" world of sword and sorcery), while the second part tells about the second server (the \"ancient Chinese\" non-magical martial arts world), however, in the manhwa \"Dusk Howler\", there is only the \"European\" server because the novel \"Dusk Howler\" consists of about 12 volumes, but the manhwa \"Dusk Howler\" showed only the events from the first two volumes of the novel. Nine, the deuteragonist in \"Dusk Howler\", is a romantic, eccentric and childish undead \/ necromancer who is similar to Wei Wuxian, the protagonist in \"The Founder of Diabolism\", while Mori, the tritagonist in \"Dusk Howler\", is a cold, strict and caring dark elf \/ swordsman who is similar to Lan Wangji, the deuteragonist in \"The Founder of Diabolism\". Nine and Mori are best friends who have been living together in a private home and acting like a loving married couple for several years, but they often quarrel and fight because Nine is a sexual pervert who likes to do indecent deeds, while Mori is an asexual tsundere who gets angry every time Nine behaves in an indecent manner. But the plot of \"Dusk Howler\" mainly revolves around the bromance relationship between Nine and the protagonist Jaiha and pays little attention to the bromance relationship between Nine and Mori. Jaiha is a shy, modest and hardworking human \/ wizard who agreed to become Nine's pupil because Nine promised that he would turn Jaiha from a pathetic loser into a great man. Both Wei Wuxian (the founder of Demonic Cultivation) and Nine (a.k.a. Chaos Lord, Dark Tower Master, etc.) are sweet and friendly jokers, but they have a reputation for being great and terrible villains because they have a huge power and regularly perform ambiguous actions. However, Wei Wuxian follows the path of a hero and does predominantly good deeds, while Nine follows the path of a villain and does predominantly evil deeds.","date":"2023-02-28T00:00:00+00:00","user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Nancy_Drew","username":"Nancy_Drew"}},{"mal_id":"12450-29457","entry":[{"mal_id":12450,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/12450\/Nononono","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/2\/261006.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/2\/261006t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/2\/261006l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/2\/261006.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/2\/261006t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/2\/261006l.webp"}},"title":"Nononono"},{"mal_id":29457,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/29457\/Aoi_Tori_no_Shinwa__Blue_Myth_Overture","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/2\/227660.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/2\/227660t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/2\/227660l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/2\/227660.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/2\/227660t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/2\/227660l.webp"}},"title":"Aoi Tori no Shinwa: Blue Myth Overture"}],"content":"Both stories are about siblings who want to achieve something in sport for the sake of their deceased sibling.","date":"2023-02-28T00:00:00+00:00","user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Adnash","username":"Adnash"}},{"mal_id":"113138-116778","entry":[{"mal_id":113138,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/113138\/Jujutsu_Kaisen","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/3\/210341.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/3\/210341t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/3\/210341l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/3\/210341.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/3\/210341t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/3\/210341l.webp"}},"title":"Jujutsu Kaisen"},{"mal_id":116778,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/116778\/Chainsaw_Man","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/3\/216464.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/3\/216464t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/3\/216464l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/3\/216464.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/3\/216464t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/3\/216464l.webp"}},"title":"Chainsaw Man"}],"content":"Many similar things, but both are still individually good.

Both series are primarily psychological crime\/revenge stories set in the typical fantasy manhwa setting.","date":"2023-02-22T00:00:00+00:00","user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/CourtRoseFaerie","username":"CourtRoseFaerie"}},{"mal_id":"84339-117473","entry":[{"mal_id":84339,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/84339\/Mizutama_Honey_Boy","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/2\/269058.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/2\/269058t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/2\/269058l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/2\/269058.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/2\/269058t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/2\/269058l.webp"}},"title":"Mizutama Honey Boy"},{"mal_id":117473,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/117473\/Heroine_Hajimemashita","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/1\/217708.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/1\/217708t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/1\/217708l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/1\/217708.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/1\/217708t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/1\/217708l.webp"}},"title":"Heroine Hajimemashita."}],"content":"Mizutama Honey Boy and Heroine For Hire have the same set-up with the strong girl and the princess-y boy.

When I was reading Gentlemen's Alliance I couldn't stop comparing it to Kitchen Princess.","date":"2023-02-21T00:00:00+00:00","user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/CourtRoseFaerie","username":"CourtRoseFaerie"}},{"mal_id":"121485-156076","entry":[{"mal_id":121485,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/121485\/Kaiko_sareta_Ankoku_Heishi_30-dai_no_Slow_na_Second_Life","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/3\/230023.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/3\/230023t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/3\/230023l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/3\/230023.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/3\/230023t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/3\/230023l.webp"}},"title":"Kaiko sareta Ankoku Heishi (30-dai) no Slow na Second Life"},{"mal_id":156076,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/156076\/Hen_na_Ryuu_to_Moto_Yuusha_Party_Zatsuyougakari_Shintairiku_de_Nonbiri_Slow_Life","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/3\/277011.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/3\/277011t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/3\/277011l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/3\/277011.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/3\/277011t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/3\/277011l.webp"}},"title":"Hen na Ryuu to Moto Yuusha Party Zatsuyougakari, Shintairiku de Nonbiri Slow Life"}],"content":"Although the MC of Hen na Ryuu had a very friendly relationship with his hero party contrary to how the MC of Kaiko sareta Ankoku Heishi, the plots for both of these stories are similar.
